# RestaurantAPI
It's my project Iâ€™ve created as a part of an online course* where I learned about ASP.NET 5 Web API.

This solution contains a simple web API for restaurant. Functionality covers CRUD operations for restaurants and dishes they do. API conatins also an authentication module which controls permissions around actions. To use API you have to login first and from that action you receive token to use in followup requests to the API. All data are stored in and retrieved from MS SQL database with use of Entity Framework. To test API you can use build-in swagger or use any tool to test APIs like Postman.
